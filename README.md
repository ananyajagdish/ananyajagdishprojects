## ClearCellGame
This project invloves two-dimensional arrays, abstract classes, and test development. Implemented code for a game named clear cell game. The game's goal is to maximize the number of cleared cells in a colored board. A graphical user interface (GUI) was provided and I developed the code that implements the rules of the game. When you click on a cell, if any of the surrounding cells (all 8 directions) are the same character they must be cleared(indicated by a "." character). When a cell is clicked, one or more rows might be cleared as a result. In this case, these rows will be collapsed.
