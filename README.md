## ClearCellGame
This project invloves two-dimensional arrays, abstract classes, and test development. Implemented code for a game named clear cell game. The game's goal is to maximize the number of cleared cells in a colored board. A graphical user interface (GUI) was provided and I developed the code that implements the rules of the game. When you click on a cell, if any of the surrounding cells (all 8 directions) are the same character they must be cleared(indicated by a "." character). When a cell is clicked, one or more rows might be cleared as a result. In this case, these rows will be collapsed.

## Aliens And SpaceShips
This is my own game where there is a player and an enemy. It is a basic shooting game where the player must shoot at then enemy and dodge bullets shot by the enemy. The player can use the awsd controls to move and the space bar to shoot.If the player or enemy is shot their health decreases. If the palyer is able to defeat the enemy they win.

## Online Test
This project represents the data manager of an online test system. The system allows for the definition of exams with three possible kinds of questions: true and false, multiple choice, and fill-in-the-blanks questions. The system will grade submitted exams and generate some statistical information.

## Orders Processor
This project processes files that represent purchase orders. Each file lists the items bought and the date of purchase. The possible items that can be purchased (along with the item's price) can be found in a item's data file. The program will generate a summary for each order (file). The summary includes the client id and a sorted list (by item's name) of each item bought. The list will include the item's name, the cost per item, the quantity of items bought, and the total cost associated with the item's purchase. After the sorted list, an order's total will be displayed. In addition to a report for each order, the program will generate a summary of all orders. The summary will display a sorted list (by item's name) providing information about the total number of items sold, and total revenue. The program will allow users to process all the orders using a single thread or one thread per order (file).

## EDU Hoot APP
EDUHoot allows users to create a budget at the beginning of each month where you can create different categories and allocate dollar amounts for them. Users can also add different expenses throughout the month. For example if I spend $20 on groceries then I would enter that in here. Users also have the ability to enter in bills so that EDUHoot can send reminders about bill dates so that the user can make sure to pay the bill on time to avoid any late fees. We build our app using Flutter and Dart.
